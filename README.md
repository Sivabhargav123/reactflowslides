 -- React Flow Slides – Draggable Slides
        This project is a simple React application built using React.js and React Flow that allows users to create, view, and drag slides as nodes inside a canvas. Each slide is represented as a draggable and selectable node with basic static content.

        This project was developed as part of a hiring assignment to demonstrate understanding of React fundamentals and integration of third-party libraries.


-- Features 

        Slides implemented as React Flow nodes

        Drag and drop slides anywhere on the canvas

        Selectable slides with visual highlight

        Custom slide component

        Clean and simple UI

-- Technologies Used

-- How It Works
        Slides are defined as nodes inside React Flow.

        Each node uses a custom component (SlideNode).

        React Flow handles drag-and-drop and selection.

        CSS highlights the selected slide.
